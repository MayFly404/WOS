# WOS
This is official Wissam OS, It works for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## How to Install:
- First, click download on the Github page.
- Next, go to [python.org](python.org) and install the most [recent version](python.org/downloads).
![Version 3.10.5](PythonRecent.png)

- Once you install python, go to your terminal/console.
- Inside the terminal/console, type pip help.
- If an error shows up, contact me.
- If it shows a bunch of options, you are good to go.
- The last thing you need to do is type in your terminal/console:
  ```
  1. pip install tkinter
  2. pip install tqdm
  3. pip install cryptography
  ```
 
## How to Login
- You will be greeted with a prompt asking for your IP_ADDRESS.
- In order to find your IP_ADDRESS, open up your terminal/console, and type `ipconfig`.
- The number next to "IPv4" is what you want.
- In the program, enter your IPv4 address, and type in your desired port
  - The deafult is 9999
- Congrats! You have logged into Wissam OS!

## Two Options
